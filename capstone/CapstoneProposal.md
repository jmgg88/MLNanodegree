## Proposal 

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

The stock markets provide a perfect environment for using big data techniques. The number of possibilities are endless, since the amount of data and the possible correlations existing between different market indicators and stock values is enormous. A proper analysis of market data can lead to a better understanding of its behaviour, unvealing unexpected properties, relations between pairs of stocks, or even providing prediction capabilities to some extent. Though a high level of theoretical controversy exists around the idea that markets can be profitably traded, many trading systems exist that, when traded consistently, show significant profit (10%-20%). More importantly, these systems are adaptative in the sense that they do not require a healthy global economy (a global rising trend) to make profit, but rather act differently in the different situations so that a benefit is achieved. Consistent and intelligent trading requires facing the markets as a statistical environment in which no certainties exist (like a poker game), trying to Benefit/Risk ratio that is put at stake in each market operation. 

The process of analyzing the markets and systematically applying a trading system that is able to detect good trading opportunities is tedious to be performed manually and, even when the system rules are clear, it is often hard to automate them since they are based on visual indicators that cannot be easily transform into a numerical detection algorithm. The aim of this project is to use Deep Learning techniques to obtain a prediction model for stock values based on their historical data. Using this prediction model able to automatically signal potential entry opportunities can be built, thus reducing the manual work to a simple review of the signaled opportunities. 


### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

The problem to solve can be stated as follows:

Design an intelligent automatic system that alerts the user whenever a profitable trading opportunity appears in any NYSE or NASDAQ traded stock. The time frame to be looked at depends on the global behaviour of the market (global ascending trend or anything else). The user shall be able to select between these two options depending on his analysis of the global market status. 

A profitable trading opportunity is defined as follows. Let's assume a prediction for the closing price of the stock exists for each of the next N days. If a position is to be taken today, let the rule of parallel colors (To be explained) define the price of the stop loss for that order. The current situation is considered a profitable trading opportunity if, for any of the next N days the following rules are fulfilled:
+The Benefit/Risk ratio is above 2.5
+The price never triggers the stop loss between day 1 and day N

Thus, the core of the system relies on a tool to predict the future expected closing price of a generic stock value for the following N days (with N in the order of a few days). 

The prediction tool will apply Deep Learning, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (and more precisely LSTMs). The prediction accuracy will be measured by comparing the actual prices of some testing set to the predicted prices (so really in terms of predicted values and not in terms of trading benefits). 


In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_

A set of 30 stocks will be selected based on the following criteria:
+ Average variation of closing price between one day and the next between 1.5% and 5%: we want to discard values which vary very little, thus presenting no trading opportunity, and very noisy values.
+ Average volume of traded contracts above 500000: we want to trade liquid stocks
+ Price range between 10$ and 150$: these values are better adapted to normal account sizes (in the order of thousand of dollars). 

For each selected stock, the following data is considered relevant to the model:
+Minimum/Maximum/Opening/Closing weekly price of the stock
+Minimum/Maximum/Opening/Closing daily price of the stock
+Volume of the stock
+Force Index of the stock (a derived indicator which is simply computed as [close(n)-close(n-1)]/volume(n). Other indirectly computed indicators could also be added during the implementation process if required. 

In addition, the following data is considered relevant for all the stocks:
+Minimum/Maximum/Opening/Closing weekly SP500 value
+Minimum/Maximum/Opening/Closing daily SP500 value

The time range to be analyzed will cover the span between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2016. This is important because different market regimes exist during this period, and the resulting model should be able to adapt to these changes. The period from year 2000 to year 2012 (included) will be used as training set, and the period from 2013 to 2016 will be used as testing set. From the set of selected stocks, 20 will be used in the training process as described above. The other 10 will be reserved for extra testing without having shown any part of their history to the system. This is necessary to test the ability of the system to generalize to any provided stock.

The data to be used for the project will be retrieved from Yahoo Finance through the python API shown in the reference (TBD). 

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

The objective of the system is to outperform the market in a real world trading scenario. To measure this, the outcome of the system will be compared against three different benchmark models for different running periods of time (of a year duration):

+ Buy (or sell) and hold for the SP500 
+ Buy (or sell) and hold for the stock at stake
+ Optimal swing trading (the model will never outperform this, but the proximity to it measures its performance better than the previous too).

The first two benchmark models simply give an indication about whether the system is any good or not. Performing worse than them simply implies a naive trading strategy is better than our sophisticated system. Performing better indicates simply the opposite, which doesn't say much about the profitability of our approach. 

The third benchmark however is an approximation to the "perfect trading strategy", one that would maximize the outcome of the market. Thus, comparing against this tells us how close the model is to the maximum possible profitability.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.
